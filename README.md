# Robot-ReactJS
This a ReactJS app I created that displays robots and their 
information obtained from Robohash.org. This app has three 
main components: the searchbox, the CardList component,
and the individual robot cards.

The app makes an API call to jsonplaceholder.com to retrieve 
the information for the individual robots. This app also uses 
the Tachyons framework to simplify the CSS styling.
